                                                    If the webhook is running within the cluster, then you should use `service`.

                                                        `port` should be a valid port number (1-65535, inclusive).

                                                    `url` gives the location of the webhook, in standard URL form
                                                    (`scheme://host:port/path`). Exactly one of `url` or `service`
                                                    must be specified.


                                                    The `host` should not refer to a service running in the cluster; use
                                                    the `service` field instead. The host might be resolved via external
                                                    DNS in some apiservers (e.g., `kube-apiserver` cannot resolve
                                                    in-cluster DNS as that would be a layering violation). `host` may
                                                    also be an IP address.


                                                    Please note that using `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` as a `host` is
                                                    risky unless you take great care to run this webhook on all hosts
                                                    which run an apiserver which might need to make calls to this
                                                    webhook. Such installs are likely to be non-portable, i.e., not easy
                                                    to turn up in a new cluster.


                                                    The scheme must be "https"; the URL must begin with "https://".


                                                    A path is optional, and if present may be any string permissible in
                                                    a URL. You may use the path to pass an arbitrary string to the
                                                    webhook, for example, a cluster identifier.
